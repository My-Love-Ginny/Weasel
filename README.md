# DespicableUs

Hi I am Severus Snape,

This is the project that have been developed so that you people could speak freely about anyone. Not everyone wants to speak openly about incidents that should be spoken about and this is not because he/she is afraid about him/her but he is part of a so called civilised society where people think they should not speak againt anyone because he/she could help in the future and even if the help is not the motive, speaking against anyone will not be fruitfull because anyone will not change the perspective of a person until something happens with them. The real world is harsh and people are only your friends until you are helping them in any way.

We are creating this platform which will provide you anonymity to post about anyone or anything and other people could support or argue with you without revealing who they are. The motto of this website will be to free people from the burden of hiding things in themselves and to make a community of people who make jokes, talk, gossip and express anger without the worry that others will judge him/her.

The most important point is the anonymity, the wesbite will never ask you to input any of your details and will give you a random name and a token associtated with it that you could save with yourself. Once this token is lost, the id you were logged in will be lost forever, not even I could get back it for you. 

The code of the website is already hosted on Github, and after about a week after hiding and removing all the variables from the code. I myself will give this code, so that you all can go through it.


Make it a happening and more importantly a worthy place.
